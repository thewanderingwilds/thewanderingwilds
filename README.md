## Introduction
Welcome to AltEd, where education is boundless and learning is an adventure. This README.md file provides an overview of AltEd, including information about investment opportunities, our philosophy, the web app, and how to get in touch with us.

## Investment
Investing in AltEd offers a strategic opportunity to contribute to educational innovation, market potential, and significant social impact. By supporting AltEd, investors can play a pivotal role in shaping a future where education is more adaptable, engaging, and inclusive, ultimately leading to a more informed, empowered, and equitable society.

### Benefits of Investing in AltEd
- Better Financial Future: Education is a significant predictor of future earnings. Studies have shown that higher levels of education correlate with higher earnings over a lifetime, with college graduates earning significantly more than those without a degree (Interactive College of Technology, 08-20-2021).
- Market Potential: The alternative education market is expanding as more families seek personalized and engaging learning experiences for their children. Investing in AltEd positions you at the forefront of this growing market, offering potential for financial growth and long-term sustainability.
- Social Impact: Educating girls, for instance, creates ripple effects that benefit entire communities and countries. It improves employment opportunities, reduces child and maternal mortality, and can even mitigate climate change by empowering girls with education and career choices in conservation, science, and economics (Plan International Australia, 03-24-2021).
- Addressing Learning Poverty: Early childhood education is pivotal in tackling learning poverty and building human capital. Investing in quality early childhood education ensures a strong foundation for lifelong learning and development (World Bank, 05-17-2022).
- Global Education Challenges: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of investing in public education worldwide. With over 1.5 billion children impacted by school closures, there's an urgent need to address educational access, equity, quality, and inclusion. Investing in education, including alternative models like AltEd, is crucial for rebuilding economies and ensuring a more equitable future (Brookings, 06-19-2020).
